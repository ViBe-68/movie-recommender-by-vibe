## Intro
This is a simple movie recommender by learning the logic from the web [^1] and replicating the code using my coding practices. This markdown file was written with the help of a markdown helper[^2].

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to simply understand the base logic behind recommenders and the way they operate. The math behind them is called **Cosine Similairity**[^3] & **Text Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**[^4].

## Tools & Platforms
+ Python 
    + Pandas
    + Numpy
    + Sci-kit Learn
+ Visual Studio Code
